# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation
Arch Technologies Project
This project presents a hybrid deep learning approach for brain tumor detection and segmentation using two state-of-the-art models: YOLOv11 and SAM2 (Segment Anything Model 2). The system is designed to automatically identify and isolate brain tumors in medical images by combining real-time object detection with high-precision image segmentation.
YOLOv11 is used to detect the presence and approximate location of tumors through bounding boxes.

SAM2 is then applied to generate detailed pixel-level masks for the detected tumor regions.

The solution is implemented and executed entirely in Google Colab and uses a public brain tumor dataset from Kaggle. The project demonstrates how advanced models can be combined effectively to support medical diagnostics, specifically in neuro-oncology.

Key components of the project include:

Preparing and training YOLOv11 on annotated brain tumor images.

Integrating SAM2 with YOLOâ€™s output to generate segmentation masks.

Visualizing and saving the results of detection and segmentation for further analysis.

This project reflects a meaningful step toward AI-assisted medical imaging and provides a scalable pipeline for tumor analysis in CT or MRI scans.
